# Rip: Retention Intelligence Platform
## Full Business Plan & Go-To-Market Strategy

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Mission**
Become the retention and habit layer for the UK fitness industry—helping gyms and studios keep members longer by operationalising human behaviour, emotion, and community, not just transactions.

**The Problem**
Fitness businesses don't lose members because of pricing or scheduling—they lose them because habits decay silently. Existing platforms (Mindbody, Glofox, ABC Fitness) track logistics brilliantly, but fail to:
- Detect emotional disengagement before it's too late
- Translate behaviour signals into actionable interventions
- Prove which retention tactics actually work
- Hold coaches and teams accountable for member retention

Owners are blind until cancellation happens, then it's too late.

**The Solution**
Rip (Retention Intelligence Platform) is a retention-only SaaS that integrates into existing gym management systems and acts as:
- A behavioural early-warning system with granular churn scoring
- An intervention effectiveness tracker (unique in the market)
- A coach & staff accountability OS (roadmap)
- A community and habit reinforcement engine

It predicts churn using multi-factor analysis, orchestrates human + automated interventions, and proves ROI by showing which messages actually bring members back.

**Strategic Positioning**
"We don't manage gyms. We manage member commitment."

**Target Customers**
Any fitness or health business with recurring members where habit, motivation, and community matter:
- Boutique studios (yoga, pilates, spin)
- CrossFit gyms
- Independent gyms (1-5 locations)
- Fitness franchises
- Online & hybrid memberships
- Wellness and coaching programmes

**Business Model**
Bootstrapped-friendly B2B SaaS: integrate-first approach, low-support overhead, expansion-driven pricing tied to retained revenue. Focus on UK market initially, with clear path to international expansion.

**Key Differentiator**
Rip is the only platform that shows gym owners which interventions actually work. While competitors send campaigns blindly, Rip tracks success rates, average days to return, and identifies fastest-performing messages—turning retention from guesswork into data-driven decisions.

## 2. Market Opportunity

**Market Size**
- UK fitness industry: £5B+ annually
- UK gym memberships: 10M+ active members
- Average gym size: 150-800 members per location
- Fitness SaaS market: Growing segment within broader health tech (£500M+)
- Retention tooling: Massively underserved niche with no dedicated players

**The Retention Math**
For a typical UK gym with 300 members at £40/month:
- Current churn: 5% monthly = 15 members lost = £600/month = £7,200/year
- With Rip (2-3% reduction): 3% monthly = 9 members lost = £360/month = £4,320/year
- **Savings: £2,880/year per location**

Even a 1–3% reduction in churn is worth tens of thousands annually to most gyms.

**Why Now**
- Post-COVID churn volatility (members more likely to cancel)
- Rising customer acquisition costs (retention is cheaper than acquisition)
- Subscription fatigue among consumers (need better engagement)
- Fitness owners realising growth ≠ retention (quality over quantity)
- Data-driven decision making becoming standard
- Integration-friendly APIs making it easier to build on top of existing systems

**Market Timing**
The fitness industry is ready for retention intelligence. Owners are frustrated with generic tools that don't solve their core problem: keeping members engaged long-term.

---

## 3. Product Vision & Core Value Proposition

**Core Promise**
Turn fragile fitness memberships into durable habits and communities—at scale.

**Your Core Insight (Moat)**
Churn is not an event. It is a multi-week behavioural and emotional unraveling that current systems don't see or act on.

**What Legacy Systems Do:**
- Mindbody & Glofox focus on: Bookings, Payments, Attendance logs
- Generic CRMs focus on: Contact management, Email blasts
- Analytics tools focus on: Historical reporting, Basic dashboards

**What Rip Does:**
- Interprets behaviour: Multi-factor churn risk scoring (7 weighted factors)
- Predicts churn: Granular 0-100 risk scores, not binary predictions
- Contextual interventions: Personalised messages based on member profile
- Proves effectiveness: Shows which interventions bring members back
- Coach accountability: Clear ownership of at-risk members (roadmap)
- Preventative action: Intervene before cancellation, not after

**Differentiation Table**

| Legacy Gym SaaS | Rip (Retention Intelligence Platform) |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Tracks activity | Interprets behaviour with granular scoring |
| Reports churn after it happens | Predicts churn with 7-factor analysis |
| Generic automations | Contextual, personalised interventions |
| No ownership model | Coach accountability (roadmap) |
| Reactive | Preventative & automated |
| No proof of ROI | Shows which interventions work (unique) |
| One-size-fits-all | Member-centric personalisation |
| Admin-focused | Retention-focused |

**Category Definition**
Rip is not gym management software. It is a **Retention Intelligence Platform for Habit-Based Businesses**.

We sit on top of existing systems, adding retention intelligence without disrupting operations.

## 4. Product Features (Current & Roadmap)

### 4.1 Retention Intelligence Engine (Core - Built)

**Multi-Factor Churn Risk Scoring**
A proprietary engine that scores every member on Commitment Health using seven weighted factors:

1. **Attendance Factor (40% weight)**
   - Days since last visit with granular scoring
   - 60+ days: Automatic high risk (85-95 score)
   - 50-59 days: High risk (70-85 score)
   - 30-49 days: High risk (50-70 score)
   - 21-29 days: Medium-high risk (35-50 score)
   - 14-20 days: Medium risk (20-35 score)
   - 7-13 days: Low-medium risk (8-20 score)
   - 1-6 days: Low risk (1-8 score)

2. **Visit Frequency Factor (15% weight)**
   - 8+ visits in last 30 days: 0 risk
   - 4-7 visits: 10 points
   - 2-3 visits: 25 points
   - 1 visit: 40 points
   - 0 visits: 60 points

3. **Proximity Factor (15% weight)**
   - Distance from gym (billing address to gym location)
   - ≤2km: 0 risk
   - ≤5km: 10 points
   - ≤10km: 25 points
   - ≤20km: 45 points
   - ≤30km: 65 points
   - >30km: 85 points

4. **Age Factor (10% weight)**
   - Teenagers (13-19): 50 points
   - Young adults (20-25): 30 points
   - Adults (26-34): 15 points
   - Middle-aged (35-49): 10 points
   - Older adults (50+): 5 points

5. **Employment/Student Status (8% weight)**
   - Students: 40 points
   - Unemployed/part-time: 20 points
   - Full-time employed: 5 points
   - Unknown: 15 points

6. **Membership Tenure (7% weight)**
   - New members (<30 days) inactive: 50 points
   - Very new (<60 days) inactive: 30 points
   - New but active: 15 points
   - Established: 5 points

7. **Campaign Response (5% weight)**
   - Already received campaign: +1.5 points

**Output:**
- Real-time churn probability (0-100 score)
- Risk level classification (none, low, medium, high)
- Granular scoring that differentiates between similar members
- Automatic updates when member activity changes

**Why This Matters:**
Unlike binary "at risk" flags, Rip's granular scoring means two members with 30 days inactivity can have different scores based on their age, distance, visit frequency, and other factors. This enables more targeted interventions.

### 4.2 Intervention Effectiveness Tracking (Unique Differentiator - Built)

**The Problem Rip Solves:**
Gym owners send campaigns but have no idea which messages actually work. Rip tracks intervention outcomes and shows success rates.

**Features:**
- **Success Rate Calculation**: Percentage of members who re-engage after each intervention
- **Average Days to Return**: How quickly members respond to different messages
- **Channel Performance**: Email vs SMS effectiveness comparison
- **Fastest-Performing Interventions**: Identifies messages that bring members back quickest
- **Underperforming Alerts**: Flags interventions with low response rates
- **Time Range Analysis**: All time, last month, quarter, or year

**MVP Attribution Model:**
- Simple, transparent attribution (last intervention before re-engagement wins)
- 14-day success window (configurable per gym)
- Directional insights, not false precision
- Clear methodology disclosure

**Why This Matters:**
This is Rip's unique moat. No competitor shows which interventions work. Gym owners can stop guessing and start optimising based on data.

### 4.3 Behavioural & Emotional Interventions (Built)

**Current Capabilities:**
- Automated email/SMS campaigns based on inactivity thresholds (21+, 30+, 60+ days)
- Template-based or custom messages
- Branded communications (gym logo, brand colours)
- Personalised messaging with member variables ({{first_name}}, {{gym_name}}, {{last_visit_date}})

**Intervention Types:**
- "We haven't seen you in a while" (friendly re-engagement)
- "Bring a friend on us" (referral offers)
- Custom campaign messages
- Template library for common scenarios
- SMS templates (5 default templates)

**Campaign Features:**
- Quick run buttons for common thresholds
- Channel selection (Email or SMS)
- Editable template content
- Custom message creation
- Campaign history tracking

**Future Enhancements (Roadmap):**
- Coach prompts when motivation drops
- Social reconnection nudges
- Programme variation suggestions
- Identity reinforcement messaging
- A/B testing for message optimisation
- Optimal send time recommendations

### 4.4 Coach Accountability OS (Roadmap - Key Differentiator)

**The Vision:**
Make retention everyone's responsibility, not just the owner's.

**Planned Features:**
- **Daily Coach Retention Inbox**: At-risk members assigned to coaches
- **Clear Ownership**: Each at-risk member has a designated coach
- **Retention Impact Per Coach**: Track which coaches are best at re-engaging members
- **Gamified Retention Performance**: Leaderboards, badges, recognition
- **Coach Actions**: Mark as contacted, record notes, update member status
- **Retention Goals**: Set targets per coach, track progress

**Why This Matters:**
This is what competitors will not build. It requires deep understanding of gym operations and coach workflows. It's Rip's strongest wedge into gyms.

### 4.5 Community Intelligence Layer (Roadmap)

**Planned Features:**
- Detect isolation vs belonging (based on class attendance patterns)
- Flags members losing social ties
- Prompts community-based saves
- Social connection scoring
- Group activity recommendations

**Community becomes measurable, not vague.**

### 4.6 Member Management & Insights (Built)

4. **SMS Providers**: Twilio, MessageBird, or similar
5. **WhatsApp Business API**: For member communications
6. **Zapier/Make**: For custom integrations

**Strategic Choice:** Integrate forever, replace never. Rip enhances existing systems rather than replacing them.

### 4.8 Branding & Customisation (Built)

- Branded email templates
- Logo display on dashboard

**Future Enhancements:**

6. **Retention-Only Focus**: Not diluted by operations features

**Defensibility:**
- Data network effects (more gyms = better insights)
